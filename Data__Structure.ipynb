        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "- A:Data structures are ways to organize and store data so it can be used efficiently. They are\n",
        "important because they help optimize operations such as searching, sorting, inserting, and deleting\n",
        "data.\n",
        "2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "- A:Mutable data types can be changed after creation, while immutable data types cannot be\n",
        "changed. Examples of mutable types include lists and dictionaries, and examples of immutable\n",
        "types include strings and tuples.\n",
        "3.: What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "- A: Lists are mutable and can be changed after creation, while tuples are immutable. Tuples are\n",
        "typically used for fixed collections of items and are slightly faster than lists.\n",
        "4.: Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "- A: Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs using a hash table. Each key is hashed to a specific\n",
        "index in an underlying array, allowing for efficient data retrieval.\n",
        "5.: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "- A: Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values and provide faster membership testing compared to\n",
        "lists. They are useful when storing unique items.\n",
        "6.: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "- A: A string is an immutable sequence of characters, whereas a list is a mutable collection that can\n",
        "hold elements of different data types.\n",
        "7.: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "- A: Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. This immutability\n",
        "ensures that data remains constant, maintaining data integrity.\n",
        "8.: What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "- A: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python\n",
        "dictionaries use hash tables to store key-value pairs, allowing fast data access.\n",
        "9.: Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "- A: Yes, Python lists can hold elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even\n",
        "other lists or objects.\n",
        "10.: Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "- A: Strings are immutable to improve performance, memory usage, and security. This immutability\n",
        "also allows strings to be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        "11.: What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "- A: Dictionaries offer faster lookups and more meaningful access through keys, making them ideal for\n",
        "scenarios involving key-value relationships.\n",
        "12.: Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "- A: Tuples are preferable when the data should not change, such as storing coordinates, fixed\n",
        "configurations, or constant values.\n",
        "13.: How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "- A: Sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring that only unique elements are stored.\n",
        "14.: How does the \"in\" keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "- A: For lists, 'in' checks for the presence of a value. For dictionaries, 'in' checks for the presence of a\n",
        "key.\n",
        "15.: Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "- A: No, you cannot modify elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. Once created, their\n",
        "content cannot be changed.\n",
        "16.: What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
        "- A: A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary. It is useful for storing hierarchical or\n",
        "structured data, such as records of students with their individual details.\n",
        "17.: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "- A: Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), thanks to the\n",
        "underlying hash table implementation.\n",
        "18.: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "- A: Lists are preferred when order matters or when the data is a simple sequence without the need\n",
        "for key-based access.\n",
        "19.: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "- A: Historically, dictionaries did not preserve insertion order. Although modern Python versions do\n",
        "preserve order, dictionaries still do not support index-based access like lists.\n",
        "20.: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "- A: Lists use integer indices to retrieve elements, while dictionaries use unique keys. This makes\n",
        "dictionaries more efficient for associative data retrieval."
